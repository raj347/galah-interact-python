==========================================

This is the main documentation for the Galah Interact project. For general

the code and the reStructuredText documents in the *docs/* directory of the
git repository. If you find an error in the documentation, please report it
in the bug tracker `here <https://www.github.com/galah-group/galah/issues>`_
